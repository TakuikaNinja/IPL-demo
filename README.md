# IPL demo

This program targets the Namco IPL Interface present in FDS games developed by Namco.

## Usage

The hex file must be loaded using the Lua script from [IPL-MAIN](https://github.com/TakuikaNinja/IPL-MAIN).

## Building

Required tools:
- CC65 toolchain: https://cc65.github.io/
- Python IntelHex library: https://github.com/python-intelhex/intelhex

A simple `make` should then work.

## Acknowledgements

`Jroatch-chr-sheet.chr` was converted from the following placeholder CHR sheet:

It contains tiles from Generitiles by Drag, Cavewoman by Sik, and Chase by shiru.

The NESdev Wiki, Forums, and Discord have been a massive help. 
Kudos to everyone keeping this console generation alive!
